# 🧹 Python Automation: Data Cleanup Tool

## 🧠 About This Project
Hi! I’m **Babalola**, a beginner Python developer passionate about automating everyday tasks for individuals and businesses.

This project is a **simple yet powerful script** that cleans messy CSV or Excel files by:
- Removing blank rows  
- Stripping extra spaces  
- Standardizing column headers  
- Saving the cleaned version automatically  

It’s great for anyone who works with exported data from Excel, web apps, or CRMs and wants to tidy it up instantly with Python.
